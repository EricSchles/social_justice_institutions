J-PAL North America, which is based at MIT, seeks to reduce poverty by ensuring that policy is informed by scientific evidence. We do this by conducting randomized evaluations, sharing policy lessons, and building evaluation capacity, and we support evaluations through three initiatives: U.S. Health Care Delivery Initiative, General Research Initiative, and State and Local Innovation Initiative.
